# Debug Google Permissions Issue

## APIs Are Enabled But Still Getting Permission Errors

Let's check a few more things:

---

## 1. Check Service Account Has IAM Permissions

**Go here:**
https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=supersub-473101

**Look for:**
`supersub@supersub-473101.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

**It should have role:** 
- "Editor" OR
- "Owner" OR
- Custom role with Docs/Drive permissions

**If it's missing or has wrong role:**
1. Click "GRANT ACCESS"
2. Enter: `supersub@supersub-473101.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Role: "Editor"
4. Save

## 2. Check Railway Has the Correct Credentials

In Railway dashboard ‚Üí API service ‚Üí Variables:

**Check `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` contains:**
```
"project_id": "supersub-473101"
"client_email": "supersub@supersub-473101.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

**NOT:**
```
"project_id": "your-project"  ‚Üê This is wrong!
```

## 3. Wait for API Propagation

Sometimes it takes a few minutes for API enablement to propagate.

**Try:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes
2. Restart your API service in Railway
3. Try a new submission

---

## 4. Check Railway Logs for Exact Error

Let's see the full error message.

**In Railway:**
1. Go to your API service
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click "View Logs"
4. Look for the full error message around the permission error

**Common errors:**
- "API has not been used in project" ‚Üí API not fully enabled yet
- "Request had insufficient authentication scopes" ‚Üí Service account needs more permissions
- "The caller does not have permission" ‚Üí IAM role issue

---

## 5. Test Service Account Manually

Let's verify the service account works.

**Try this command locally:**

```bash
# Install gcloud if you haven't
# brew install google-cloud-sdk

# Set the credentials
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/key.json

# Test creating a doc
curl -X POST \
  'https://docs.googleapis.com/v1/documents' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Document"
  }'
```

If this fails, the service account itself has issues.

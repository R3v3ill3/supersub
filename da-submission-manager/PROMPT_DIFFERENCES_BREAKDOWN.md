## USER TEMPLATE CHANGES (submission.user.hbs)

### Change 1: Remove APPLICANT_NAME Field ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Old (line 4):**
```
APPLICANT_NAME: {{applicant_name}}
```

**New:**
```
[removed]
```

**Impact:** 
- **Risk:** LOW - This field was never populated anyway (always empty)
- **Benefit:** Cleaner prompt
- **Related to user input:** NO

---

### Change 2: Add CUSTOM_GROUNDS Section ‚≠ê PRIMARY GOAL
**Old (line 21):**
```
USER_STYLE_SAMPLE:
{{{user_style_sample}}}

[file ends]
```

**New (lines 21-22):**
```
USER_STYLE_SAMPLE:
{{{user_style_sample}}}

CUSTOM_GROUNDS (user-provided additional concerns):
{{{custom_grounds}}}
```

**Impact:**
- **Risk:** NONE - Just adds a new section
- **Benefit:** User's custom text reaches the AI
- **Related to user input:** ‚úÖ YES - **This is the critical fix**

---

### Change 3: Add Examples Section (lines 24-51)
**Old:**
```
[nothing]
```

**New:**
```
---

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT CONCERN REPRODUCTION:

If SELECTED_CONCERNS contains:
  KEY: bulk_excavation
  BODY: |
    Approximately 12,600 m¬≥ of cut, 2,400 m¬≥ of fill...

Your output section should include:

## 4. Bulk Excavation and Earthworks

The proposed development involves extensive earthworks...

CORRECT ELEMENTS:
‚úì All specific measurements preserved: "12,600 m¬≥"...
‚úì All technical terms preserved: "steep batters"...

INCORRECT (DO NOT DO THIS):
‚úó "The development involves substantial excavation..."
   [This loses all specific measurements]
```

**Impact:**
- **Risk:** LOW - Just provides examples to AI
- **Benefit:** AI better understands how to preserve measurements
- **Related to user input:** NO - This helps with full_text preservation

## SYSTEM PROMPT CHANGES (submission.system.txt)

### Old Version (8 lines total):
```
You are drafting a plain-text council submission letter. You must strictly follow these rules:
‚Ä¢ Use only the information provided in APPROVED_FACTS and SELECTED_CONCERNS and the tone cues from USER_STYLE_SAMPLE.
‚Ä¢ Do not add any fact, link, statistic, claim, date, or source not present in the inputs.
‚Ä¢ No emojis. No em dashes. No rhetorical devices such as antithesis or call-and-response. No meta commentary. No self-reference.
‚Ä¢ Write in clear Australian English. Short, direct sentences. Neutral, civic tone. No salesy phrasing.
‚Ä¢ Keep to {{MAX_WORDS}} words or fewer.
‚Ä¢ Output only valid JSON matching the provided schema. Do not include explanations.
```

### New Version Changes (136 lines total):

---

### Change Category A: USER INPUT HANDLING ‚≠ê PRIMARY GOAL

**A1. USER_STYLE_SAMPLE Instructions**

**Old:**
```
Use tone cues from USER_STYLE_SAMPLE
```

**New (line 40):**
```
If USER_STYLE_SAMPLE is provided and non-empty, BEGIN with it verbatim as the opening statement
If USER_STYLE_SAMPLE is empty, create an appropriate opening stating clear opposition
```

**Impact:**
- **Risk:** MEDIUM - Changes from style guide to verbatim inclusion
- **Benefit:** User sees their exact words in output
- **Related to user input:** ‚úÖ YES - **This makes user intro appear**

---

**A2. CUSTOM_GROUNDS Instructions**

**Old:**
```
[nothing - doesn't mention CUSTOM_GROUNDS]
```

**New (lines 47-52):**
```
‚Ä¢ MAIN BODY - Structure your numbered sections as follows:
  
  A) If CUSTOM_GROUNDS contains text:
     - Start with Section 1 containing the CUSTOM_GROUNDS verbatim (do not modify user's text)
     - Give it an appropriate heading based on the content
     - Then continue with SELECTED_CONCERNS as Section 2, 3, 4, etc.
  
  B) If CUSTOM_GROUNDS is empty:
     - Start directly with SELECTED_CONCERNS as Section 1, 2, 3, etc.
```

**Impact:**
- **Risk:** NONE - Only applies when custom_grounds provided
- **Benefit:** Custom grounds appear first in output
- **Related to user input:** ‚úÖ YES - **This makes custom grounds appear**

---

### Change Category B: FULL_TEXT DATA PRESERVATION

**B1. Comprehensiveness Requirements**

**Old:**
```
Use only the information provided
```

**New (section 2, lines 16-36):**
```
2. COMPREHENSIVENESS (USE ALL SOURCE MATERIAL):
   ‚Ä¢ Include COMPLETE content from ALL selected concerns - DO NOT summarize or truncate
   ‚Ä¢ PRESERVE ALL SPECIFIC DATA VERBATIM:
     - Measurements (e.g., "12,600 m¬≥ of cut", "2,400 m¬≥ of fill")
     - Planning code references (e.g., "Planning Scheme Code 8.2.3.1")
     - Standard references (e.g., "AS 2601-1991")
   ‚Ä¢ IF content cannot fit in {{MAX_WORDS}} words, prioritize completeness over brevity
```

**Impact:**
- **Risk:** LOW - Improves data preservation
- **Benefit:** Ensures measurements and codes appear verbatim
- **Related to user input:** NO - But improves output quality

---

**B2. Data Fidelity Validation**

**Old:**
```
[nothing]
```

**New (section 6.5, lines 104-112):**
```
6.5. FIDELITY VALIDATION (SELF-CHECK BEFORE RESPONDING):
   Before finalizing your response, verify:
   ‚Ä¢ COUNT CHECK: Every key from SELECTED_CONCERNS appears as a distinct numbered section
   ‚Ä¢ DATA CHECK: All specific measurements, quantities, and statistics appear verbatim
   ‚Ä¢ NO MERGING: No concepts from different SELECTED_CONCERNS were combined
   ‚Ä¢ WORD COUNT: Your output approaches {{MAX_WORDS}} words (should be 70-100% of limit)
```

**Impact:**
- **Risk:** NONE - Just adds quality checks
- **Benefit:** More consistent, thorough output
- **Related to user input:** NO

---

### Change Category C: FORMATTING IMPROVEMENTS

**C1. Bullet Point Formatting**

**Old:**
```
[no specific guidance]
```

**New (lines 92-94):**
```
‚Ä¢ CRITICAL: When using bullet lists, do NOT add blank lines between bullet items
‚Ä¢ Blank lines should only appear between different sections or between paragraphs and lists
‚Ä¢ Within a bulleted list, items should be consecutive (no blank lines between them)
```

**Impact:**
- **Risk:** NONE - Prevents line break issues
- **Benefit:** Fixes your bullet point rendering problem
- **Related to user input:** NO - But fixes layout issue you noticed

---

**C2. Structure and Headings**

**Old:**
```
[no guidance]
```

**New (lines 58-68):**
```
For EACH concern:
  1. Create a numbered section with the concern's label as the heading
  2. Include the COMPLETE concern body - copy it verbatim
  3. ALL specific data must appear: measurements, statistics, code references
  4. Use subsections (1.1, 1.2) ONLY if source explicitly discusses distinct sub-topics
  - Preserve ALL specific references to:
    * Measurements and quantities
    * Gold Coast City Plan sections
    * Planning scheme codes and zone codes
    * Australian Standards
```

**Impact:**
- **Risk:** LOW - Just adds detail to existing behavior
- **Benefit:** More consistent structure
- **Related to user input:** NO

---

### Change Category D: OUTPUT FORMAT CLARITY

**D1. JSON Output Format**

**Old:**
```
Output only valid JSON matching the provided schema. Do not include explanations.
```

**New (section 7, lines 117-131):**
```
7. OUTPUT FORMAT:
   ‚Ä¢ Output ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
     {
       "final_text": "your complete grounds for submission text here"
     }
   ‚Ä¢ Do not include property details, submitter details, or declaration
   ‚Ä¢ CRITICAL: Do NOT include "Applicant: [Name]" anywhere
   ‚Ä¢ Do not use markdown code blocks - output raw JSON only
   ‚Ä¢ DO NOT output the input fields (RECIPIENT_NAME, SITE_ADDRESS, etc.)
   ‚Ä¢ DO NOT create a JSON object with the input metadata

CRITICAL REMINDER: Your output must be JSON with a single field "final_text"...
```

**Impact:**
- **Risk:** LOW - Clarifies existing requirement
- **Benefit:** Prevents the JSON confusion we saw in Railway logs
- **Related to user input:** NO - But fixes OpenAI confusion

## Change Summary by Category

### üéØ User Input Related (Your Primary Goal):
1. ‚úÖ USER_STYLE_SAMPLE verbatim inclusion (line 40)
2. ‚úÖ CUSTOM_GROUNDS section added (lines 47-52)
3. ‚úÖ CUSTOM_GROUNDS in user template (line 21-22)

**Risk:** LOW to MEDIUM  
**Benefit:** HIGH - User text will appear  
**Required:** YES for user input to work

---

### üìä Data Quality Improvements (Already Benefiting From):
1. ‚úÖ Comprehensiveness requirements (section 2)
2. ‚úÖ Data preservation rules (measurements, codes)
3. ‚úÖ Fidelity validation checks (section 6.5)
4. ‚úÖ Examples showing preservation (user template)

**Risk:** LOW  
**Benefit:** HIGH - Better adherence to source material  
**Required:** NO - But makes output better

---

### üé® Formatting Improvements:
1. ‚úÖ Bullet formatting rules (no blank lines)
2. ‚úÖ Structure guidance (numbered sections)
3. ‚úÖ Markdown formatting specs

**Risk:** NONE  
**Benefit:** MEDIUM - Fixes rendering issues  
**Required:** NO - But improves display

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Reliability:
1. ‚úÖ JSON output format clarification
2. ‚úÖ Explicit schema requirements
3. ‚úÖ Prevention of metadata echo-back

**Risk:** NONE  
**Benefit:** HIGH - Prevents OpenAI confusion  
**Required:** NO - But reduces errors

---

## Option 1: Copy Everything (Recommended)

**Command:**
```bash
cp packages/prompts/submission.system.txt apps/api/packages/prompts/
cp packages/prompts/submission.user.hbs apps/api/packages/prompts/
```

**You Get:**
- ‚úÖ User input appears (your goal)
- ‚úÖ Better data preservation (already working, but more reliable)
- ‚úÖ Better formatting (fixes bullet issues)
- ‚úÖ Better error handling (fixes OpenAI confusion)

**Risks:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è USER_STYLE_SAMPLE changes from "tone guide" to "verbatim inclusion"
  - This is what you wanted, but changes behavior
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More verbose prompts = slightly higher token costs
  - But you said you're OK with costs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Untested combination of all changes together
  - Though each change individually is low risk

---

## Option 2: Surgical Update (Just User Input)

Create minimal versions that ONLY add user input handling:

**Minimal system.txt changes:**
- Keep the old 8-line prompt mostly intact
- Add: "If USER_STYLE_SAMPLE provided, include it verbatim at start"
- Add: "If CUSTOM_GROUNDS provided, include as Section 1"

**Minimal user.hbs changes:**
- Add only lines 21-22 (CUSTOM_GROUNDS section)
- Skip the examples

**Pros:** Minimal behavior change  
**Cons:** Miss out on other improvements, still have bullet formatting issues

---

## Option 3: Incremental Rollout

1. **Week 1:** Copy just user.hbs (adds CUSTOM_GROUNDS section)
2. **Week 2:** If stable, copy system.txt (comprehensive instructions)
3. **Week 3:** Monitor and adjust

**Pros:** Lower risk, can rollback easily  
**Cons:** Slower to get all benefits

---

## Recommendation

**Copy everything (Option 1)** because:

1. ‚úÖ You've already tested locally and it works beautifully
2. ‚úÖ The backup exists if anything goes wrong
3. ‚úÖ All changes are improvements, none are regressions
4. ‚úÖ The old prompts are genuinely outdated (Sep 28)
5. ‚úÖ You wanted the behavior changes (verbatim inclusion)
6. ‚úÖ Fixes multiple known issues (bullets, JSON format, user input)

**Rollback is easy:**
```bash
# If problems arise
cp packages/prompts/submission.user.hbs.backup-2025-10-02-working packages/prompts/submission.user.hbs
cp packages/prompts/submission.system.txt.backup-2025-10-02-working packages/prompts/submission.system.txt
# Then copy to API directory
```

## What You're Currently Running With

**The OLD prompts are:**
- ‚úÖ Working (producing output)
- ‚úÖ Preserving measurements (thanks to full_text backfill)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing user input completely
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Creating bullet formatting issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing OpenAI (wrong JSON format)

**The NEW prompts will:**
- ‚úÖ Everything the old ones do
- ‚úÖ Plus user input inclusion
- ‚úÖ Plus better formatting
- ‚úÖ Plus clearer AI instructions
- ‚úÖ Plus better error prevention

---

## My Assessment

**Risk Level: LOW**

All the changes are additive improvements. The only "change" in behavior is making USER_STYLE_SAMPLE verbatim instead of tone-guide, which is **exactly what you asked for**.

The real question is: Do you want the user input feature? If yes, you need at least the CUSTOM_GROUNDS section from the new template.

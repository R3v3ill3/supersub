## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Use Split View for Editing
The split view is the most efficient way to work:
- Edit HTML on the left
- See changes instantly on the right
- No need to toggle between modes
- Catch formatting issues immediately

### 2. Test Your HTML First
Before pasting long HTML:
- Test with a simple `<p>Test</p>` first
- Verify the preview works
- Then paste your full content
- Adjust styling as needed

### 3. Keep HTML Simple
Email clients have limitations:
- ‚úÖ Use inline styles: `<p style="color: red;">`
- ‚úÖ Use basic tags: `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<a>`, `<br>`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid CSS classes (may not work in all clients)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid complex layouts (may break in Gmail/Outlook)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test in multiple email clients if possible

### 4. Add Personalization Strategically
Place `{{name}}` where it makes sense:
- ‚úÖ `<p>Dear {{name}},</p>` (greeting)
- ‚úÖ `<p>Thank you, {{name}}, for your support</p>` (mid-email)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid overusing - 1-2 times is usually enough

### 5. Check Links Before Sending
All links should:
- Use full URLs: `https://cv.uconstruct.app/...`
- Open in new tab (optional): `target="_blank"`
- Have descriptive text: "Lodge an objection here" not "click here"

### 6. Use the Preview Modal
Before creating the campaign:
- Click "Preview Full Email"
- Review the complete email
- Check From/Subject/Body all together
- Verify formatting looks professional

## üîß Advanced Features

### HTML Formatting

You can use most standard HTML:

**Text Formatting:**
```html
<strong>Bold text</strong>
<em>Italic text</em>
<u>Underlined text</u>
```

**Links:**
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Link text</a>
<a href="mailto:email@example.com">Email link</a>
```

**Line Breaks:**
```html
<br>          <!-- Single break -->
<br><br>      <!-- Double break (paragraph spacing) -->
```

**Paragraphs:**
```html
<p>Paragraph text</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Centered text</p>
<p style="color: red;">Red text</p>
```

**Lists:**
```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

### Styling

Use inline styles for best compatibility:

```html
<!-- Text color -->
<p style="color: #1976d2;">Blue text</p>

<!-- Background color -->
<p style="background-color: #fff3e0;">Highlighted text</p>

<!-- Font size -->
<p style="font-size: 18px;">Larger text</p>

<!-- Text alignment -->
<p style="text-align: center;">Centered</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Right-aligned</p>

<!-- Multiple styles -->
<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">
  Important message
</p>
```

### Emojis

Emojis work great in emails:
```html
<p>Thank you for standing up for our valley. üå≥</p>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
<p>üö® Urgent: Act now!</p>
```

## üì± Email Client Compatibility

Your HTML will work in most email clients, but be aware:

‚úÖ **Full Support:**
- Gmail (web, iOS, Android)
- Apple Mail (Mac, iOS)
- Outlook.com (web)
- Yahoo Mail

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Support:**
- Outlook Desktop (avoid complex CSS)
- Older email clients

üí° **Best Practice:** Keep it simple - basic HTML works everywhere!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Updating
- Check you're in **Preview** or **Split View** mode
- Try clicking another mode, then back to Split View
- Refresh the page if needed

### HTML Not Rendering Correctly
- Check for unclosed tags: `<p>` needs `</p>`
- Verify quotes around attributes: `href="url"`
- Remove any `<script>` tags (not allowed in emails)

### Personalization Not Working
- Use double curly braces: `{{name}}` not `{name}`
- Case-sensitive: `{{name}}` not `{{Name}}`
- In preview, appears as "Sample Recipient"
- Real names used when actually sending

### Links Not Clickable
- Ensure proper format: `<a href="https://...">text</a>`
- Use full URLs including `https://`
- Test by clicking in preview mode
- Some email clients block links by default (user must allow)

# Prompts Synced - Ready for Deployment

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

The prompt files have been successfully synced from root to API directory.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Files Synced
```bash
✅ Copied: packages/prompts/submission.system.txt → apps/api/packages/prompts/
✅ Copied: packages/prompts/submission.user.hbs → apps/api/packages/prompts/
```

### 2. Verification Passed
```
✅ Template lines: 52 (was 21)
✅ System prompt lines: 136 (was 8)
✅ Files are identical between locations
✅ CUSTOM_GROUNDS section present
✅ USER_STYLE_SAMPLE section present
✅ Examples section present
✅ Test compilation successful
```

### 3. Backups Created
```
✅ apps/api/packages/prompts/submission.system.txt.backup-2025-10-02-working
✅ apps/api/packages/prompts/submission.user.hbs.backup-2025-10-02-working
```

---

## What Changed

### User Input Handling ⭐
- **USER_STYLE_SAMPLE:** Now included verbatim at start (was "tone guide")
- **CUSTOM_GROUNDS:** Now included as section 1 (was not in template at all)

### Data Quality
- Comprehensive preservation rules for measurements and codes
- Full_text support instructions
- Fidelity validation checks

### Formatting
- No blank lines between bullet items (fixes rendering)
- Better structure guidance
- Proper heading hierarchy

### Reliability
- Clear JSON output format (prevents OpenAI confusion)
- Explicit field requirements
- Better error prevention

---

## Expected Results After Deployment

### Before (Old Prompts):
```
Output:
  - Has measurements ✅ (from full_text backfill)
  - Missing user intro ❌
  - Missing custom grounds ❌
  - Bullet line breaks ❌
  - OpenAI JSON confusion ⚠️
```

### After (New Prompts):
```
Output:
  - Has measurements ✅
  - User intro at start ✅
  - Custom grounds as section 1 ✅
  - Clean bullet rendering ✅
  - Reliable JSON format ✅
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
cd /Volumes/DataDrive/cursor_repos/supersub/da-submission-manager

git add apps/api/packages/prompts/submission.system.txt
git add apps/api/packages/prompts/submission.user.hbs
git add apps/api/packages/prompts/*.backup-2025-10-02-working

git commit -m "Sync prompt files: Add user input support and comprehensive instructions

- Add CUSTOM_GROUNDS section to user template
- Update USER_STYLE_SAMPLE to verbatim inclusion
- Add comprehensive data preservation rules
- Fix bullet formatting (no blank lines between items)
- Clarify JSON output format for OpenAI
- Create backups of working versions"
```

### 2. Push to Railway
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment
Watch Railway logs for:
- ✅ Build success
- ✅ "OpenAI generation successful" or "Claude generation successful"
- ✅ No "invalid content type" errors
- ✅ Output includes user text

---

## Testing After Deployment

### Test Case 1: User Introduction
1. Create new submission
2. Enter introduction: "As a 15-year resident of Currumbin Valley, I strongly oppose this development."
3. Leave custom grounds empty
4. Select some concerns
5. Generate

**Expected:**
- ✅ Opening paragraph starts with: "As a 15-year resident of Currumbin Valley..."
- ✅ Exact user text appears verbatim

---

### Test Case 2: Custom Grounds
1. Create new submission
2. Enter introduction: "I object to this development."
3. Enter custom grounds: "I am particularly concerned about impacts on koala habitat connectivity and local wildlife corridors."
4. Select some concerns
5. Generate

**Expected:**
- ✅ Opens with: "I object to this development."
- ✅ Section 1: Custom concern about koalas (verbatim)
- ✅ Section 2+: Selected concerns with measurements

---

### Test Case 3: Both Fields
1. Enter both intro and custom grounds
2. Select concerns
3. Generate

**Expected:**
- ✅ Intro verbatim at start
- ✅ Custom grounds as section 1
- ✅ Selected concerns as section 2+
- ✅ All measurements preserved
- ✅ Clean bullet formatting

---

## Rollback Plan

If any issues arise after deployment:

```bash
# Restore old versions (from before today)
git log --oneline apps/api/packages/prompts/
# Find commit from Sep 28
git checkout <commit-hash> -- apps/api/packages/prompts/

# OR restore from backup
cp apps/api/packages/prompts/submission.system.txt.backup-2025-10-02-working apps/api/packages/prompts/submission.system.txt
cp apps/api/packages/prompts/submission.user.hbs.backup-2025-10-02-working apps/api/packages/prompts/submission.user.hbs
```

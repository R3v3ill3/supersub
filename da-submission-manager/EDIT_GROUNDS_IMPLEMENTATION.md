# Edit Grounds Only - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the feature to restrict editing to **grounds content only**, protecting the document structure, metadata, and legal declarations from user modifications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API (`apps/api/src/routes/generate.ts`)

**Location**: Lines 248-255

**Change**: Updated API response to return both the grounds-only content and the full formatted preview:

```typescript
const response: any = {
  ok: true,
  preview: formattedSubmission,      // Backwards compatibility
  groundsOnly: finalText,             // NEW: Just AI-generated grounds
  fullPreview: formattedSubmission,   // NEW: Complete formatted document
  submissionId,
  status: 'READY_FOR_REVIEW'
};
```

**Impact**: Zero breaking changes - added new fields while keeping existing `preview` field.

---

### 2. Frontend State (`apps/web/src/pages/SubmissionForm.tsx`)

**Location**: Lines 201-212

**Changes**:
- Replaced `generatedText` with `groundsText` (editable grounds)
- Replaced `originalGeneratedText` with `originalGroundsText` (for reset)
- Added `fullPreview` (complete formatted document for display)

**Old State**:
```typescript
const [generatedText, setGeneratedText] = useState<string>('');
const [originalGeneratedText, setOriginalGeneratedText] = useState<string>('');
```

**New State**:
```typescript
// Grounds content (editable by user)
const [groundsText, setGroundsText] = useState<string>('');
const [originalGroundsText, setOriginalGroundsText] = useState<string>('');
// Full preview (for display only - includes headers, declaration, etc.)
const [fullPreview, setFullPreview] = useState<string>('');
```

---

### 3. Generation Success Handler

**Location**: Lines 358-369

**Change**: Updated to populate both grounds and preview state:

```typescript
onSuccess: (data) => {
  // Set the editable grounds content
  const grounds = data.groundsOnly || '';
  setGroundsText(grounds);
  setOriginalGroundsText(grounds);
  
  // Set the full formatted preview
  const preview = data.fullPreview || data.preview || '';
  setFullPreview(preview);
  
  setStep(4);
}
```

---

### 4. Submit Handlers

**Location**: Lines 375, 389-390

**Changes**: Both preview and submit now send only grounds content:

```typescript
// Preview email body
mutationFn: async () => {
  const response = await api.submissions.previewEmailBody(
    submissionId, 
    { finalText: groundsText }  // Changed from generatedText
  );
  return response.data;
}

// Submit to council
mutationFn: async () => {
  const response = await api.submissions.submit(
    submissionId, 
    { 
      finalText: groundsText,  // Send only grounds - backend re-formats
      emailBody: emailBody 
    }
  );
  return response.data;
}
```

---

### 5. Step 4 UI - Edit/Preview Mode

**Location**: Lines 1296-1452

**Major Changes**:

#### Header & Instructions (Lines 1305-1326)
- Reset button checks `groundsText !== originalGroundsText`
- Instructions clarified: "Edit your objection grounds below"
- Explains that headers/declaration are auto-generated

#### Edit Mode (Lines 1338-1352)
- Textarea now edits `groundsText` instead of full document
- Added helpful hint explaining what's being edited
- Word count shows grounds-only count

**New UI**:
```tsx
<textarea
  value={groundsText}
  onChange={(e) => setGroundsText(e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Edit your objection grounds here..."
  ...
/>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2 italic">
  💡 You're editing only the objection grounds. Your property details, 
  contact information, and the legal declaration will be added 
  automatically from your form data when you submit.
</p>
```

#### Preview Mode (Lines 1353-1380)
- Shows `fullPreview` instead of edited text
- Displays complete formatted submission with all sections

#### Reset Modal (Lines 1410-1448)
- Resets `groundsText` to `originalGroundsText`
- Updated messaging to clarify it resets grounds only

#### Button States (Lines 1383-1398)
- Continue button checks `groundsText.trim()` instead of full text

## What Users Can Now Edit

### ✅ EDITABLE (Grounds Section Only)
- Introduction paragraph
- Objection points (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Supporting arguments
- Conclusion paragraph
- Any custom content added

### ❌ PROTECTED (Auto-generated)
- Document headers
- Property details (lot number, plan number, address)
- Submitter details (name, address, email)
- Application number
- "Grounds of submission:" header with To/From/Date
- Footer statements about planning compliance
- **Declaration section** (legal requirements)
- Electronic signature
- Submission date

---

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Old Behavior)
1. Generate submission → Full formatted document
2. User edits → Can modify EVERYTHING including declarations
3. Submit → Whatever user edited is sent (risky!)

### After (New Behavior)
1. Generate submission → Grounds content + full preview stored
2. **Edit mode**: User edits ONLY grounds text
3. **Preview mode**: User sees complete formatted submission
4. Submit → Grounds sent, backend re-formats with current metadata
5. PDF generated → Always has correct structure and declarations

---

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Generation**: 
   - LLM produces `finalText` (grounds only)
   - `SubmissionFormatterService` wraps it with structure
   - API returns both to frontend

2. **User Editing**:
   - Edit textarea bound to `groundsText` state
   - Preview shows `fullPreview` (the original formatted version)
   - User can only modify grounds content

3. **Submission**:
   - Frontend sends `groundsText` to backend
   - Backend calls `formatGoldCoastSubmission()` again
   - Re-wraps grounds with latest metadata from database
   - Ensures structure is always correct

4. **PDF Generation**:
   - Receives re-formatted markdown
   - Always has correct headers/declarations
   - No changes to `pdfGenerator.ts` needed

### Why This Works

The system was **already architected** for this pattern:

```typescript
// Backend already had this separation!
const finalText = generateSubmission(...);  // Grounds only
const formatted = formatter.formatGoldCoastSubmission({
  ...metadata,
  grounds_content: finalText  // Wraps with structure
});
```

We just exposed both to the frontend and bound UI correctly.

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [x] No linter errors in modified files
- [ ] Generate submission → verify grounds appear in textarea
- [ ] Edit grounds → verify changes save in state
- [ ] Switch to Preview → verify full formatted document shows
- [ ] Preview includes headers, declaration, metadata
- [ ] Word count shows grounds-only count
- [ ] Reset button → restores original grounds
- [ ] Continue to Email Preview → uses edited grounds
- [ ] Submit → PDF has correct structure
- [ ] PDF contains edited grounds content
- [ ] Declaration is correct and unmodified
- [ ] Metadata comes from form data, not edits

### Edge Cases to Test

- [ ] Empty grounds text → button disabled
- [ ] Very long grounds (>5000 words) → renders correctly
- [ ] Special markdown characters → preserved in edit
- [ ] Copy/paste from Word → handles gracefully
- [ ] Back button from Step 5 → grounds still editable
- [ ] Multiple edit/preview cycles → no state corruption

### Regression Testing

- [ ] PDF generation still works
- [ ] Email sending still works  
- [ ] Document workflow unchanged
- [ ] Database operations unchanged
- [ ] Previous submissions viewable

---

## Files Modified

1. `/apps/api/src/routes/generate.ts` (1 function, 3 lines changed)
2. `/apps/web/src/pages/SubmissionForm.tsx` (multiple sections, ~150 lines changed)

**Total Changes**: ~153 lines across 2 files

**Complexity**: Low-to-Moderate

**Risk**: Low - well-isolated changes, no breaking impacts

---

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ **Fully maintained** - API still returns `preview` field for any legacy code

```typescript
const response: any = {
  ok: true,
  preview: formattedSubmission,  // Old field - still works
  groundsOnly: finalText,         // New field
  fullPreview: formattedSubmission, // New field
  submissionId,
  status: 'READY_FOR_REVIEW'
};
```

---

## Next Steps

### Deployment
1. Review changes in staging environment
2. Test complete user flow
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor for any issues

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Add live preview (update full preview as user types)
- [ ] Add character/paragraph count in addition to word count
- [ ] Add "Download Preview" button to get PDF before submitting
- [ ] Add side-by-side edit/preview on desktop
- [ ] Add validation to detect if user pastes full document

### Documentation
- [ ] Update user guide with new editing behavior
- [ ] Update training materials
- [ ] Add FAQ about what's editable

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is simple:

1. **Backend**: Remove the two new fields from API response
2. **Frontend**: Revert state variables to old names
3. **Or**: Just deploy previous commit (changes are well-isolated)

**Risk**: Minimal - changes don't affect database or document generation logic

---

## Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:
- User edit success rate
- Submission completion rate (should not decrease)
- PDF generation errors (should not increase)
- Support tickets about editing (should decrease)

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Implementation Complete**

The feature successfully restricts user editing to grounds content only, protecting critical document structure and legal declarations. The system leverages existing architecture patterns and introduces minimal new code.

**Key Achievement**: Users can now safely edit their objection grounds while the system ensures all submissions maintain proper structure, current metadata, and legal compliance.

**Status**: Ready for testing and deployment.

## Update: Submitter Name Confusion Fix

**Issue**: AI-generated text was incorrectly including the submitter's name as "Applicant: [Name]"

**Fix Applied**:
1. Removed `applicant_name` from LLM metadata to prevent confusion
2. Enhanced post-processing to detect and replace/remove submitter names
3. Updated system prompt with explicit instructions
4. See `FIX_SUBMITTER_NAME_CONFUSION.md` for full details

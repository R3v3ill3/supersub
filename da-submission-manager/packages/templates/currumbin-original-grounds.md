**From:** {{firstname}} {{lastname}}
**Date:** {{date}}

{{optional_introduction}}

**I strongly oppose the proposed development of High Trees Primary School at 940 Currumbin Creek Road. This submission outlines my objections based on the proposed development's non-compliance with the Gold Coast City Plan, the South-East Queensland Regional Plan (SEQRP), and the Rural Zone Code. I urge the Council to issue a deemed refusal for this development application due to its significant negative impacts on Currumbin Valley's rural community, environmental integrity, and infrastructure.**

**1. Non-Compliance with the Gold Coast City Plan**

**1.1. Strategic Framework Non-Compliance**

The proposed development directly contradicts the intent of the **Gold Coast City Plan**, which designates the area as part of the **Natural Landscape Area**. Specifically:

- **Intrusion on Natural Landscape**: The development encroaches on the rural landscape, violating the goals outlined in **Strategic Framework Map 2 -- Settlement Pattern** and undermining efforts to preserve the hinterland core habitat.

- **Impact on Greenspace and Habitat Areas**: The proposed development conflicts with **Strategic Framework Map 4**, which identifies the area as part of the **greenspace network**. This network is critical for maintaining local wildlife habitats and corridors, including for birds and koalas. The introduction of urban-type facilities like this school threatens these habitats.

**1.2. Rural Zone Code Non-Compliance**

The proposed development's **intensity**, **scale**, and **traffic generation** are inconsistent with the intended land use in the Rural Zone. The project would lead to a detrimental change in the area's character and quality of life, violating key sections of the City Plan, including:

- **Part 3, Section 3.7.2.1(1) and (3)** -- Non-compliance with provisions aimed at protecting natural landscapes.

- **Part 3, Section 3.7.3.1(6) and (10)** -- Impact on the greenspace network and landscape character.

- **Rural Zone Code Sections 6.2.20.2(2)(a)(i)-(v) and 6.2.20.2(2)(b)(i)** -- The proposed facility introduces an urban-scale development that is at odds with the area's rural intent.

The **scale and form** of this educational facility are inappropriate for the rural landscape, as the area is intended for low-impact, rural land uses, not urban infrastructure.

**2. Non-Compliance with the South East Queensland Regional Plan (SEQRP)**

**2.1. Protection of Rural Values**

The site falls within the **Regional Landscape and Rural Production Area (RLRPA)** under the SEQRP, which aims to protect rural values from urban encroachment. The proposed educational facility introduces infrastructure that is incompatible with the rural character of the RLRPA.

**2.2. Inappropriate Urban Development**

The **SEQRP** specifically restricts inappropriate urban development in the RLRPA. The applicant's assertion that an education facility is an acceptable land use is flawed. While the applicant claims that the school will support the rural community, there is no **substantive evidence** of community demand for this facility in the immediate rural area. Most prospective students are expected to come from urban areas, which undermines the purpose of the RLRPA to maintain the rural landscape and prevent urban sprawl.

**3. Traffic and Parking Issues**

**3.1. Insufficient Infrastructure**

The proposed infrastructure is inadequate to support the development:

- **Diverge/Deceleration Lane**: The current road infrastructure cannot support the additional traffic generated by the development. Insufficient sightlines and road width make the necessary diverge lane unfeasible, creating potential traffic hazards.

- **Car Parking**: The applicant's proposed parking arrangements do not meet the required capacity. With only 13 spaces for 25 staff, this violates the **GCCC Transport Code 2016 (PO25/AO25.1, Condition 9.4.13-3)**. The **use of overflow parking on grassed, steep areas** is both unsafe and fails to meet basic accessibility standards.

- **Bus Service**: The applicant's response provides vague details about the proposed bus service. Two small buses are insufficient to significantly reduce car traffic, and there are no clear operational commitments to support regular use.

- **Bicycle Parking**: The plans do not provide for **Security Level B** bicycle parking, as required by **Australian Standards AS2890.3.2015**. Additionally, there are no **end-of-trip facilities** provided, which are essential for an educational facility under the **Transport Code**.

**3.2. Traffic Intensity**

The school will generate substantial traffic beyond daily student transport, including:

- Service and maintenance vehicles, which will contribute to **congestion and safety concerns** on narrow rural roads.

- Special event traffic, which has not been adequately accounted for in the applicant's traffic assessments, leading to **further strain on local infrastructure**.

**3.3. Ingress/Egress and Road Safety Concerns**

The site's ingress/egress location presents dangerous conditions. Sight distances are claimed to meet Austroads standards only by undertaking substantial verge reprofiling, battering, and retaining works. The presence of an Armco barrier along this section demonstrates Council's own recognition of road safety risks. This change does not resolve the community's concerns about traffic hazards and instead creates new issues for public road safety.

**3.4. Easement Extension**

The applicant proposes not only to use an existing easement for access but also to **extend the easement** to facilitate turning movements and traffic flows. This materially alters the land tenure arrangements and extends the development footprint in a way that was not previously notified to the community.

**4. Amenity and Environmental Concerns**

**4.1. Noise and Visual Impact**

- **Noise Pollution**: Despite the applicant's updated **Noise Impact Assessment**, significant concerns remain about the **constant noise levels** from buses, car doors, and school activities, which will disrupt the tranquillity of the rural area. The **acoustic management measures** are inadequate, particularly for event days and peak drop-off/pick-up times.

- **Visual Intrusion**: The development's scale and form, along with insufficient **vegetative screening**, will detract from the natural rural landscape, causing visual pollution.

**4.2. Environmental Impact**

- **Ecological Disruption**: The proposed development impacts an area of significant vegetation and threatens local biodiversity. The **Arborist report** submitted by the applicant fails to sufficiently address these environmental concerns, and the removal of trees, even if limited, compromises the ecological integrity of the site.

- **Water Quality**: The development will increase **runoff and pollution**, which may harm local water bodies and groundwater, both of which are critical for drinking and irrigation purposes.

- **Bushfire Risk**: The development increases the risk of bushfires in a high-risk rural area, complicating emergency management and endangering personal safety and property.

**4.3. Bulk Excavation and Earthworks**

The design requires approximately **12,600 m³ of cut, 2,400 m³ of fill, and 7,000 m³ of soil to be exported off-site**, with steep batters as tight as 1:1 and extensive retaining walls. This scale of earthworks significantly increases construction impacts, truck movements, and long-term visual scarring of the rural landscape.

**4.4. Vegetation Removal and Verge Works**

To facilitate access, additional vegetation clearance is proposed, including the removal of significant trees. This not only undermines the ecological integrity of the site but also conflicts with the community's expectation that rural landscape character and biodiversity values be preserved. Council has previously indicated that retaining structures within the public road reserve are not supported, yet the application relies heavily on such works.

**4.5. Combined Visual and Amenity Impacts**

The combination of easement extension, large-scale excavation, steep batters, retaining walls, and vegetation removal substantially increases the development's visual bulk and undermines the rural amenity of Currumbin Valley.

**5. Community Needs and Infrastructure**

**5.1. Lack of Demonstrated Need**

The applicant has not demonstrated a legitimate need for a school in this rural setting. The **majority of prospective students** are likely to come from urban and suburban areas, further contradicting the intent of the RLRPA, which is to preserve rural land for appropriate rural uses.

**5.2. Operational Concerns**

- **Extended Hours**: The applicant acknowledges **extended hours for after-school care**, but this will result in increased noise and traffic, disturbing the local community.

- **Lighting and Security**: The **lack of detailed lighting and security plans** poses concerns for adjacent residents, particularly with regard to light pollution and safety during off-hours.

- **Inadequate Access**: The proposed driveway sealing is insufficient for the expected increase in traffic, and long-term maintenance concerns have not been adequately addressed.

**Conclusion**

The proposed development of **High Trees Primary School** is unsuitable for the Currumbin Valley rural area. It violates multiple planning frameworks, will severely impact the quality of life of local residents, disrupt the rural landscape, and pose significant environmental and infrastructure risks. The **non-compliance with both the Gold Coast City Plan and SEQ Regional Plan**, coupled with the council's previous refusal of a similar development in Bains Road Currumbin Valley in 2020, are compelling grounds for rejecting this Development Application.

The amended proposal fails to resolve these fundamental objections and instead introduces new and more significant impacts. It remains inconsistent with the intent of the Gold Coast City Plan, the SEQRP, and the Rural Zone Code, which seek to preserve the natural landscape and rural amenity of the Currumbin Valley.

I urge the Council to refuse this development application and to prioritize the preservation of the rural character, environmental integrity, and community welfare of Currumbin Valley.

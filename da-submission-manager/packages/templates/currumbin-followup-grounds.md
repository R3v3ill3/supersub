**Subject:** **Further Objection -- Changed Development Application MCU/2024/185, High Trees Primary School, 940 Currumbin Creek Road**

**Introduction**

I lodged a detailed submission in October 2024 objecting to the proposed development of High Trees Primary School at 940 Currumbin Creek Road. I maintain all of the grounds outlined in that submission, as the revised ("changed") application fails to address the fundamental conflicts with the Gold Coast City Plan, the South-East Queensland Regional Plan (SEQRP), and the Rural Zone Code.

This further submission highlights additional concerns arising from the applicant's amended proposal.

**Amended/Further Grounds for Objection**

**1. Ingress/Egress Relocation -- Ongoing Traffic Safety Risks**

The applicant has relocated the site's ingress/egress to another section of Currumbin Creek Road that remains dangerous. Sight distances are claimed to meet Austroads standards only by undertaking substantial verge reprofiling, battering, and retaining works. The presence of an Armco barrier along this section demonstrates Council's own recognition of road safety risks. This change does not resolve the community's concerns about traffic hazards and instead creates new issues for public road safety.

**2. Easement Extension**

The applicant proposes not only to use an existing easement for access but also to **extend the easement** to facilitate turning movements and traffic flows. This materially alters the land tenure arrangements and extends the development footprint in a way that was not previously notified to the community.

**3. Bulk Excavation and Earthworks**

The revised design requires approximately **12,600 m³ of cut, 2,400 m³ of fill, and 7,000 m³ of soil to be exported off-site**, with steep batters as tight as 1:1 and extensive retaining walls. This scale of earthworks far exceeds what was originally presented, significantly increasing construction impacts, truck movements, and long-term visual scarring of the rural landscape.

**4. Vegetation Removal and Verge Works**

To facilitate the revised access, additional vegetation clearance is proposed, including the removal of significant trees. This not only undermines the ecological integrity of the site but also conflicts with the community's expectation that rural landscape character and biodiversity values be preserved. Council has previously indicated that retaining structures within the public road reserve are not supported, yet the changed application relies heavily on such works.

**5. Visual and Amenity Impacts**

The combination of easement extension, large-scale excavation, steep batters, retaining walls, and vegetation removal substantially increases the development's visual bulk and undermines the rural amenity of Currumbin Valley.

**Conclusion**

The amended proposal fails to resolve the original grounds for objection and instead introduces new and more significant impacts. It remains inconsistent with the intent of the Gold Coast City Plan, the SEQRP, and the Rural Zone Code, which seek to preserve the natural landscape and rural amenity of the Currumbin Valley.

I respectfully request that Council refuse the application in its amended form, on the grounds that it is an inappropriate urban use in a rural landscape, with unacceptable traffic, environmental, and amenity impacts.

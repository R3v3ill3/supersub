EXAMPLE OF CORRECT CONCERN REPRODUCTION:

If SELECTED_CONCERNS contains:
  KEY: bulk_excavation
  BODY: |
    Approximately 12,600 m³ of cut, 2,400 m³ of fill, and 7,000 m³ of soil export, with steep batters and extensive retaining walls causing significant construction impacts and permanent visual scarring.

Your output section should include:

## 4. Bulk Excavation and Earthworks

The proposed development involves extensive earthworks. Approximately 12,600 m³ of cut, 2,400 m³ of fill, and 7,000 m³ of soil export are planned, with steep batters and extensive retaining walls causing significant construction impacts and permanent visual scarring.

CORRECT ELEMENTS:
✓ All specific measurements preserved: "12,600 m³", "2,400 m³", "7,000 m³"
✓ All technical terms preserved: "steep batters", "extensive retaining walls"
✓ All impacts preserved: "construction impacts", "permanent visual scarring"
✓ Only minimal text added for flow: "The proposed development involves extensive earthworks."

INCORRECT (DO NOT DO THIS):
✗ "The development involves substantial excavation with significant visual impacts."
   [This loses all specific measurements and technical details]
✗ "Approximately 12,000+ m³ of excavation is proposed."
   [This generalizes and loses the breakdown of cut/fill/export]

REMEMBER: Include ALL data points, measurements, and technical terms from the source verbatim.

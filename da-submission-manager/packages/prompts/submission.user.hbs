===== INPUT DATA =====

CRITICAL: You are writing an OBJECTION to a development application.
- The submitter (person objecting) will be identified separately - DO NOT mention their name in the grounds
- The developer/applicant name is UNKNOWN - never state who submitted the DA
- Application number: {{application_number}}
- Site address: {{site_address}}

NEVER write phrases like:
✗ "development application by [name]"  
✗ "proposal by [name]"
✗ "applicant [name]"

CORRECT phrasing:
✓ "this development application"
✓ "the proposed development"  
✓ "the applicant has not demonstrated..." (generic, not naming them)

===== APPROVED FACTS (SOURCE MATERIAL) =====

===== END OF SOURCE MATERIAL =====

Now draft the grounds for submission using ALL the concerns above.

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT:
You MUST respond with ONLY this JSON structure (no other fields):
{
  "final_text": "your complete grounds for submission text here"
}

DO NOT output fields like "recipient_name", "subject", "body", etc.
ONLY output the single field "final_text" containing the full grounds text.

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT CONCERN REPRODUCTION:

If SELECTED_CONCERNS contains:
  KEY: bulk_excavation
  BODY: |
    Approximately 12,600 m³ of cut, 2,400 m³ of fill, and 7,000 m³ of soil export, with steep batters and extensive retaining walls causing significant construction impacts and permanent visual scarring.

Your output section should include:

## 4. Bulk Excavation and Earthworks

The proposed development involves extensive earthworks. Approximately 12,600 m³ of cut, 2,400 m³ of fill, and 7,000 m³ of soil export are planned, with steep batters and extensive retaining walls causing significant construction impacts and permanent visual scarring.

CORRECT ELEMENTS:
✓ All specific measurements preserved: "12,600 m³", "2,400 m³", "7,000 m³"
✓ All technical terms preserved: "steep batters", "extensive retaining walls"
✓ All impacts preserved: "construction impacts", "permanent visual scarring"
✓ Only minimal text added for flow: "The proposed development involves extensive earthworks."

INCORRECT (DO NOT DO THIS):
✗ "The development involves substantial excavation with significant visual impacts."
   [This loses all specific measurements and technical details]
✗ "Approximately 12,000+ m³ of excavation is proposed."
   [This generalizes and loses the breakdown of cut/fill/export]

REMEMBER: Include ALL data points, measurements, and technical terms from the source verbatim.

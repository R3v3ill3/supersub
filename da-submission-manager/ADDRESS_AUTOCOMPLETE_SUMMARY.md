# Address Autocomplete Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Google Places Autocomplete has been added to the **Residential Address** field in the Submitter Details section of the submission form.

## 📍 Location

- **Page:** Submission Form (Step 1)
- **Section:** Submitter Details
- **Field:** Residential Address *
- **Project Tested:** Works for all projects (tested with high-trees-currumbin-valley)

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User starts typing** their residential address
2. **Google suggests addresses** as they type (Australian addresses only)
3. **User selects** the correct address from dropdown
4. **Auto-fills:**
   - Street address
   - Suburb
   - State
   - Postcode

5. **User can still manually edit** any field after selection

## 🚀 What You Need To Do

### 1. Get a Google Places API Key

Follow the detailed guide: **`GOOGLE_PLACES_SETUP.md`**

Quick steps:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Enable "Places API"
3. Create API key
4. Restrict it to Places API only
5. Add your website domains

### 2. Add API Key to Environment

**Local Development:**
Create `/apps/web/.env.local`:
```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Vercel Production:**
1. Go to Vercel Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `VITE_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` = your API key
3. Redeploy

### 3. Test It!

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/high-trees-currumbin-valley

Try typing an address in the "Residential Address" field!

## 💰 Cost

**FREE** for most use cases!
- Google provides $200/month free credit
- Covers ~70,000 address lookups per month
- For typical usage (100-1000 submissions/month), cost is $0

## 🛡️ Graceful Fallback

**If API key not configured:**
- Field works as regular text input
- Small info message appears

# Quick PDF Formatting Fix Guide

## What Was Wrong ❌

Your submission PDFs looked like this:
```
Supporting & Objecting & Grounds of submission: To: Mr Tim Baker Chief Executive 
Officer Gold Coast City Council Subject: Objection to Development Application 
COM/2025/271 940 Currumbin Creek Road, Currumbin Valley, QLD From: TROY BURTON

submission concerns the Development Application for the site at 940 Currumbin Creek 
Road, Currumbin Valley. It focuses on planning matters and public interest 
considerations relevant to the council&#x27;s planning controls...
```

**Problems:**
- One giant wall of text
- No headings
- No paragraph breaks
- HTML entities showing (`&#x27;`)
- Completely unreadable
- Unprofessional

## What's Fixed ✅

Now your PDFs will look like this:

## Non-Compliance with Planning Framework

The intensity and scale of the proposed development are inconsistent 
with the intended land use in the **Rural Zone**. This urban-scale 
development is inappropriate for the rural landscape. 

It violates key sections of the **Gold Coast City Plan** aimed at 
protecting natural landscapes and greenspace networks. The development 
site is within the **Regional Landscape and Rural Production Area**.

## Bulk Excavation and Earthworks

The extensive earthworks required for the development include 
**12,600 m³ of cut** and **2,400 m³ of fill**. This will lead to 
significant construction impacts and long-term visual scarring of 
the rural landscape.

The proposal includes large-scale excavation, steep batters, and 
retaining walls that are inappropriate for the area.

## Amenity and Environmental Concerns

The development will create noise pollution and visual intrusion...

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Clear section headings
- ✅ Proper paragraphs
- ✅ Bold key terms
- ✅ No HTML entities
- ✅ Professional layout
- ✅ Page numbers

## The Bug 🐛

**One line of code was destroying everything:**

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
.replace(/\s+/g, ' ')  // This removed ALL newlines!

// After (FIXED):
.replace(/[ \t]+/g, ' ')  // Only removes extra spaces, keeps newlines
```

## Files Changed

1. **contentRules.ts** - Fixed whitespace handling + HTML entity decoding
2. **aiGrounds.ts** - AI now generates proper markdown formatting
3. **pdfGenerator.ts** - Enhanced typography, spacing, page numbers

## Test It

To test the fix:

1. **Generate a new submission** (any pathway)
2. **Check the PDF attachment** in the email
3. **Verify:**
   - Headings are visible and larger
   - Paragraphs are separated
   - Key terms are bold
   - No `&#x27;` or other HTML entities
   - Page numbers at bottom
   - Professional appearance

## What If It Doesn't Work?

If PDFs still look broken:

1. **Check logs** for PDF generation errors
2. **Verify** the AI is generating markdown (look for `##` in output)
3. **Test sanitization** - ensure newlines aren't being stripped
4. **Check email service** - might be converting PDF to text

## No Breaking Changes ✅

- All existing code still works
- No database changes needed
- No environment variable changes
- All validation rules still apply
- Backward compatible

## Customization Options

### Organization Name
You can customize the organization name shown in the sender:

#### Project-Level (Per Council Campaign)
```sql
UPDATE projects 
SET from_name = 'Save Our Coastline Coalition'
WHERE slug = 'gold-coast-currumbin';
```
Result: `"John Smith (via Save Our Coastline Coalition)"`

#### System-Level (Default for All)
```env
DEFAULT_FROM_NAME="Community Advocacy Network"
```
Result: `"John Smith (via Community Advocacy Network)"`

### Alternative Formats

If you want to change the format from `"Name (via Org)"` to something else:

#### Option 1: Dash Separator
```typescript
const enhancedFromName = `${applicantName} - ${organizationName}`;
// Result: "John Smith - DA Submission Manager"
```

#### Option 2: Forward Slash
```typescript
const enhancedFromName = `${applicantName} / ${organizationName}`;
// Result: "John Smith / DA Submission Manager"
```

#### Option 3: On Behalf Of
```typescript
const enhancedFromName = `${applicantName} on behalf of ${organizationName}`;
// Result: "John Smith on behalf of DA Submission Manager"
```

#### Option 4: Just Name (No Organization)
```typescript
const enhancedFromName = applicantName;
// Result: "John Smith"
// Note: Less transparent, might confuse council about source
```

**Recommendation**: Stick with `"(via ...)"` format - it's clear, professional, and transparent.

## Testing

### Visual Testing

1. **Send a test submission**
2. **Check inbox display**:
   - Look at how the sender appears in the inbox list
   - Should show: `John Smith (via DA Submission Manager)`
3. **Open the email**:
   - Full from field should show: `"John Smith (via DA Submission Manager)" <noreply@yourorganization.org>`
4. **Click Reply**:
   - To: field should auto-populate with `john.smith@gmail.com`

### Spam Score Testing

Use tools like:
- [Mail-Tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com/) - Check spam score
- [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) - Analyze headers

Send a test to these services to verify:
- ‚úÖ Sender name is properly formatted
- ‚úÖ Reply-To is set correctly
- ‚úÖ No SPF/DKIM issues
- ‚úÖ Low spam score

---

## Security & Compliance

### ‚úÖ No Security Concerns
- Still sending from your verified email address
- Not spoofing the sender email (only changing display name)
- Fully compliant with email standards

### ‚úÖ Email Authentication Still Works
- **SPF**: Still passes (sending from your domain)
- **DKIM**: Still passes (signed by your email provider)
- **DMARC**: Still passes (aligned with your domain)

### ‚úÖ Transparent & Honest
- Clearly indicates it's sent "via" your organization
- Not pretending to be directly from the user
- Council can identify facilitated submissions

---

## Rollback Plan

If for any reason you need to revert to system-only sender name:

```typescript
// Change this:
const enhancedFromName = `${applicantName} (via ${organizationName})`;

// Back to this:
const enhancedFromName = project.from_name || process.env.DEFAULT_FROM_NAME || 'DA Submission Manager';
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Sender name is too long and gets truncated**
```
Solution: Use a shorter organization name
DEFAULT_FROM_NAME="DA Manager" instead of "Development Application Submission Manager"
```

**Q: Want to use different format per project**
```
Solution: Modify the format logic to check project settings
if (project.use_simple_from) {
  enhancedFromName = applicantName;
} else {
  enhancedFromName = `${applicantName} (via ${organizationName})`;
}
```

**Q: Some councils still filtering**
```
Solution: Consider Phase 3 (OAuth) or contact council IT department
```

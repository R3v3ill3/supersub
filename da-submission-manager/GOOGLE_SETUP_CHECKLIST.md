# Google Docs Setup Checklist for "review" Pathway

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issue: Your Credentials Are Placeholders!

Your current `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` contains:
- `"project_id":"your-project"` ‚Üê This is a placeholder!
- `"client_email":"your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"` ‚Üê Also placeholder!

**These are NOT real credentials.** They're example values that need to be replaced.

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need for Option 1 (Review Pathway)

### 1. Real Google Cloud Credentials

**Status:** ‚ùå Not configured (placeholders only)

**What you need:**
- A Google Cloud Project
- Service Account with Docs & Drive API access
- Real JSON key file

**How to get it:**

#### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Click "Select a project" ‚Üí "New Project"
3. Name it something like "DA Submission Manager"
4. Click "Create"
5. Note the **Project ID** (e.g., `da-submission-12345`)

#### Step 2: Enable Required APIs

1. In your project, go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
2. Search for and enable:
   - **Google Docs API**
   - **Google Drive API**

#### Step 3: Create Service Account

1. Go to "IAM & Admin" ‚Üí "Service Accounts"
2. Click "Create Service Account"
3. Name: `da-submission-service`
4. Description: "Service account for DA submission document generation"
5. Click "Create and Continue"
6. Role: Select "Editor" (or create custom with Docs + Drive access)
7. Click "Continue" ‚Üí "Done"

#### Step 4: Generate JSON Key

1. Click on the service account you just created
2. Go to "Keys" tab
3. Click "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create new key"
4. Choose "JSON"
5. Click "Create"
6. **A file will download** - this is your real credentials file!

#### Step 5: Update Railway Environment Variable

1. Open the downloaded JSON file
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents (it will look like this but with REAL values):
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "da-submission-12345",
  "private_key_id": "abc123def456...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgk...[LONG STRING]...==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "da-submission-service@da-submission-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "123456789012345678901",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/..."
}
```

3. In Railway dashboard:
   - Go to your API service
   - Click "Variables"
   - Find `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
   - Replace the placeholder with the ENTIRE JSON content (as one line, no formatting)
   - Click "Deploy"

---

### 2. Google Drive Folder ID (Optional)

**Status:** Not set (OK - it's optional)

**What it does:** 
- If set: Generated documents are stored in a specific folder
- If not set: Documents are created in the root of the service account's Drive

**Do you need it?** 
- ‚ùå No - it's completely optional
- ‚úÖ Leave it empty for now

**To set it up later (optional):**
1. Create a folder in Google Drive
2. Share it with the service account email
3. Get the folder ID from the URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/[THIS_IS_THE_ID]`
4. Add to Railway as `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`

---

### 3. Google Doc Template IDs in Database

**Status:** ‚ùì Need to check

These are stored in your Supabase database in the `template_files` table for your project.

**What you need:**

For the "review" pathway, your project needs:
- A Google Doc template for the cover letter
- A Google Doc template for the grounds document

**Two options:**

#### Option A: Use Existing Templates (If You Have Them)

If you already have Google Docs you want to use as templates:

1. Open the Google Doc in your browser
2. Get the ID from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/document/d/[THIS_IS_THE_TEMPLATE_ID]/edit`
3. Share the document with your service account email (from step 4 above)
4. Give it "Editor" permissions
5. Save the template ID to your project in the admin interface

#### Option B: Let the System Create Templates (Fallback)

The code has fallback templates built-in. If no templates are configured, it will create basic documents.

**For testing:** You can skip template setup and use the fallback templates.

---

### 4. Switch Back to Review Pathway

**Current:** Using `'direct'` (broken - sends text files)  
**Needed:** Change to `'review'` (works - sends PDFs)

Already done in your recent changes! Just need to make sure when you redeploy, you use:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/pages/SubmissionForm.tsx line 228
submission_pathway: 'review',
```

---

## üéØ Quick Setup Path (Minimum to Test)

**Absolute minimum to test emails:**

1. ‚úÖ **Get real Google credentials** (Steps 1-5 above) - **~10 minutes**
2. ‚úÖ **Update Railway variable** with real credentials - **~2 minutes**
3. ‚úÖ **Switch to review pathway** (if not already) - **~1 minute**
4. ‚ùå **Skip** Drive folder ID (optional)
5. ‚ùå **Skip** custom templates (use fallback)
6. ‚úÖ **Test submission**

**Total time: ~15 minutes**

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After setup:

- [ ] Railway variable `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` has REAL values (not "your-project")
- [ ] Service account email looks like: `name@project-id-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- [ ] Google Docs API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Google Drive API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Web app is using `submission_pathway: 'review'`
- [ ] Create a test submission
- [ ] Check Railway logs for document creation
- [ ] Check email queue for sent email

---

## üîç How to Verify Your Setup

### Check if credentials are real:

```bash
# In Railway dashboard or your .env, check if you see:
"project_id": "your-project"  # ‚ùå This is FAKE
"project_id": "da-submission-12345"  # ‚úÖ This is REAL
```

### Check if APIs are enabled:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. You should see "Google Docs API" and "Google Drive API" in the enabled list

### Check if service account exists:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
2. Select your project
3. You should see your service account listed

---

## üö® Common Issues

### "Invalid credentials"
- Check that you copied the ENTIRE JSON (including the outer `{ }`)
- Check for no extra quotes or escaping in Railway variable
- Make sure you're using the JSON format, not P12

### "Permission denied"
- Make sure the Docs and Drive APIs are enabled
- Check that the service account has the right role (Editor)

### "Document not found"
- Make sure template docs are shared with the service account email
- Give "Editor" permission, not just "Viewer"

2. **Generate real credentials**
3. **Update Railway** with real JSON
4. **Test submission**

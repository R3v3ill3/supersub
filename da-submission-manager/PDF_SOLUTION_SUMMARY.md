# PDF Generation Solution - No Google Docs Needed!

## ✅ What We Implemented

Instead of fighting with Google Drive quotas, we implemented **direct PDF generation** using Puppeteer.

### The Solution:
1. **Markdown → HTML → PDF pipeline**
   - Takes the generated markdown content
   - Converts to styled HTML using `marked`
   - Renders to PDF using `puppeteer`
   - Professional formatting with proper typography

2. **Direct pathway now generates REAL PDFs**
   - Cover letter PDF
   - Grounds submission PDF
   - Both sent directly to council via email

3. **No Google Docs/Drive needed**
   - ✅ No quota issues
   - ✅ No ownership transfers
   - ✅ No shared drives
   - ✅ Simpler architecture

## 🚀 What Was Deployed

### New Files:
- `apps/api/src/services/pdfGenerator.ts` - Puppeteer-based PDF generator

### Modified Files:
- `apps/api/src/services/documentWorkflow.ts` - Uses PDF generator instead of text files
- `apps/web/src/pages/SubmissionForm.tsx` - Back to "direct" pathway

### Dependencies Added:
- `puppeteer` - Headless browser for PDF generation
- `marked` - Markdown to HTML converter

## 🧪 Testing

After Railway deploys (2-3 minutes):

1. **You can remove these Railway variables** (no longer needed):
   - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_OWNER_EMAIL`

2. **Submit a test**:
   - Fill out the form
   - Generate content
   - Submit
   - Should work now!

3. **What happens**:
   - PDFs generated from markdown
   - Email queued with PDF attachments
   - Within 60 seconds, email sent to council via SendGrid
   - Council receives proper PDF documents

## 📧 Email Contents

**To:** Council email (or test email)  
**Subject:** Development application submission opposing application number [number]  
**Attachments:**
- `DA_Cover_[address].pdf` - Professional PDF cover letter
- `DA_Submission_[address].pdf` - Professional PDF grounds document

**Body:** Applicant details and submission context

## ⚙️ How It Works

### The Pipeline:

```
User Input
    ↓
AI Generation (markdown)
    ↓
Markdown → HTML (marked library)
    ↓
HTML → PDF (puppeteer)
    ↓
PDF → Email Attachment (nodemailer + SendGrid)
    ↓
Council receives professional PDFs
```

### PDF Styling:
- A4 page size
- 2cm margins
- Professional serif fonts (Georgia/Times New Roman)
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Justified text
- Clean, readable layout

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Environment Variables:
- ✅ `EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid`
- ✅ `SENDGRID_API_KEY=...`
- ✅ `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=...`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL=...`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...`

### NO LONGER NEEDED:
- ❌ `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
- ❌ `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`
- ❌ `GOOGLE_DRIVE_OWNER_EMAIL`

You can delete these from Railway!

## 🐛 If Issues Occur

### Railway Deployment:
- Puppeteer needs Chromium to run
- Railway should handle this automatically
- If you get "Chrome not found" error, Railway may need additional config

### Memory Issues:
- Puppeteer can be memory-intensive
- If Railway runs out of memory, we can optimize:
  - Reduce concurrent PDF generations
  - Use puppeteer-core with external Chrome
  - Process PDFs sequentially instead of parallel

### Alternative If Puppeteer Doesn't Work on Railway:
- Use `pdfkit` library instead (lighter weight, but less formatting control)
- Or use a PDF generation API service
- Let me know and I can switch approaches

<p>Dear {{name}},<br><br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cv.uconstruct.app/high-trees-currumbin-valley">Lodge an objection here!</a></p>

<p>The clock is ticking. Another application has been lodged for <strong>940 Currumbin Creek Road ‚Äì High Trees Primary (Application number COM/2025/271)</strong>, and we need to act quickly.</p>

<p>We have <strong><a href="https://cv.uconstruct.app/high-trees-currumbin-valley">updated the template objection letter</a></strong> for everyone to use ‚Äì please download it/follow link and submit as soon as possible. If you'd prefer to write your own, you must lodge it by <strong>Thursday 10 October</strong>.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Why it matters</strong><br>
In addition to all the things we have previously raised and had concerns with, the new plan adds a wide new driveway through one of the most beautiful tree-canopy sections of Currumbin Creek Road, a turning lane, and the loss of character and the road verge. It also brings heavy earthworks on a steep, unstable slope ‚Äì adding traffic and noise, and destroying amenity. These are all valid <strong>grounds for objection</strong>.</p>

<p>Every objection counts. We must show strong, united community opposition ‚Äì numbers are critical.</p>

<p>Please don't wait. <strong>Act before 10 October.<br><br>use this <a href="https://cv.uconstruct.app/high-trees-currumbin-valley">tool</a> to help create and lodge a submission - it takes less than 2 minutes!</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for standing up for our valley. üå≥<br><br>Currumbin Valley Community Care</p>

# PDF Submission Formatting Fix

## Critical Issue Identified

The submission PDFs being generated and sent as email attachments were completely unreadable with the following problems:

1. **All text appeared as a single wall of text** with no paragraph breaks
2. **HTML entities were visible** (e.g., `&#x27;` instead of apostrophes)
3. **No headings, structure, or formatting** - making submissions look unprofessional
4. **Missing visual hierarchy** - unable to distinguish sections

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Content Sanitization Bug (CRITICAL)
**File:** `apps/api/src/services/contentRules.ts`

The sanitization function was using:
```typescript
.replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
```

This **collapsed ALL whitespace** including newlines into single spaces, destroying all document structure and formatting. This is why submissions appeared as unreadable walls of text.

### 2. AI Generation Not Using Formatting
**File:** `apps/api/src/services/aiGrounds.ts`

The AI prompt instructed:
> "Output plain text only (not JSON, not markdown headers)."

This prevented the AI from generating properly structured markdown with headings, making the documents harder to read.

### 3. HTML Entity Encoding
HTML entities like `&#x27;` were appearing in the output, making the text look unprofessional.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Content Sanitization ‚úÖ
**Location:** `contentRules.ts` - `sanitizeAndValidate()` function

**Changes:**
- Added HTML entity decoding for common entities (`&#x27;`, `&quot;`, `&amp;`, etc.)
- Changed whitespace handling from `/\s+/g` to `/[ \t]+/g` - **NOW PRESERVES NEWLINES**
- Added newline normalization to prevent excessive blank lines (max 2 consecutive)
- Preserved document structure while still removing problematic formatting

**Before:**
```typescript
.replace(/\s+/g, ' ')  // ‚ùå Destroyed ALL formatting
```

**After:**
```typescript
.replace(/[ \t]+/g, ' ')    // ‚úÖ Only collapses spaces/tabs
.replace(/\n{3,}/g, '\n\n') // ‚úÖ Limits excessive blank lines
```

### 2. Enhanced AI Prompt for Better Formatting ‚úÖ
**Location:** `aiGrounds.ts` - `generateGroundsText()` function

**Changes:**
- Updated prompt to request **markdown formatting with proper structure**
- Specified use of `##` for main headings, `###` for subsections
- Requested **bold formatting** for key terms, code references, and measurements
- Required **proper paragraph breaks** for readability
- Maintained all existing data preservation requirements

**Key Addition:**
```
3. FORMATTING & STRUCTURE:
   - Use markdown formatting for professional appearance
   - Use ## for main section headings
   - Use ### for subsections if needed
   - Use **bold** for key planning terms and specific measurements
   - Break content into clear paragraphs (separate with blank lines)
```

### 3. Professional PDF Generation ‚úÖ
**Location:** `pdfGenerator.ts` - `generatePdfFromMarkdown()` function

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Better typography** with improved heading hierarchy (levels 1-4)
- **Improved spacing** around headings, paragraphs, and lists
- **Professional title page** with centered title and decorative separator line
- **Automatic page numbering** ("Page X of Y" at bottom)
- **Smart pagination** - prevents orphaned headings
- **Better line spacing** (1.3x for paragraphs, 1.2x for lists)
- **Enhanced list formatting** with better indentation
- **Larger font sizes** for headings (15pt for H2, 13pt for H3)

**Improvements:**
- Added `bufferPages: true` for page numbering support
- Improved heading detection and formatting
- Added `previousWasHeading` tracking for better spacing
- Changed paragraph alignment from 'justify' to 'left' for better readability
- Added automatic page breaks when needed

## Expected Results

### Before (Broken)
```
Supporting & Objecting & Grounds of submission: To: Mr Tim Baker Chief Executive Officer Gold Coast City Council Subject: Objection to Development Application COM/2025/271 940 Currumbin Creek Road, Currumbin Valley, QLD From: TROY BURTON Date: 1 October 2025 To: Council Assessment Team Subject: Submission regarding Development Application COM/2025/271 Applicant: TROY BURTON Application Number: COM/2025/271 Site Address: 940 Currumbin Creek Road, Currumbin Valley, QLD This submission concerns the Development Application for the site at 940 Currumbin Creek Road, Currumbin Valley.

```

### After (Professional) ‚úÖ
```
## Non-Compliance with Planning Framework

The intensity and scale of the proposed development are inconsistent with the 
intended land use in the **Rural Zone**. This urban-scale development is 
inappropriate for the rural landscape.

It violates key sections of the **Gold Coast City Plan** aimed at protecting 
natural landscapes and greenspace networks. The development site is within the 
**Regional Landscape and Rural Production Area**.

## Bulk Excavation and Earthworks

The extensive earthworks required include **12,600 m¬≥ of cut** and **2,400 m¬≥ 
of fill**, leading to significant construction impacts. They will also cause 
long-term visual scarring of the rural landscape.

The proposal includes large-scale excavation, steep batters, and retaining 
walls that are inappropriate for the area.
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Direct Submission
```bash
# Generate a new submission
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/submissions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "...",
    "submission_pathway": "direct",
    ...
  }'
```

### 2. Check the Generated PDF
- Open the PDF attachment from the email
- Verify:
  - ‚úÖ Clear heading hierarchy
  - ‚úÖ Proper paragraph breaks
  - ‚úÖ Bold text for key terms
  - ‚úÖ No HTML entities visible
  - ‚úÖ Page numbers at bottom
  - ‚úÖ Professional appearance
  - ‚úÖ Readable structure

### 3. Verify Content Preservation
- Ensure all specific measurements appear verbatim
- Check that no data was lost in sanitization
- Confirm planning code references are intact

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `apps/api/src/services/contentRules.ts` - Fixed sanitization
2. `apps/api/src/services/aiGrounds.ts` - Enhanced AI prompt
3. `apps/api/src/services/pdfGenerator.ts` - Professional PDF generation

### Key Functions Changed
- `sanitizeAndValidate()` - Preserves newlines
- `generateGroundsText()` - Requests markdown formatting
- `generatePdfFromMarkdown()` - Enhanced typography and layout
- `renderFormattedText()` - Added line spacing support

## Impact

### Positive Changes
‚úÖ **Professional appearance** - Submissions now look like formal council documents
‚úÖ **Improved readability** - Clear structure with headings and paragraphs
‚úÖ **Better typography** - Proper font sizes, spacing, and alignment
‚úÖ **No data loss** - All content preservation rules still enforced
‚úÖ **Page numbers** - Professional multi-page documents

‚úÖ Data preservation requirements (measurements, codes, etc.)
‚úÖ Content fidelity (no invented facts)
‚úÖ Link validation

## Deployment Notes

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing APIs remain compatible
- Database schema unchanged
- Environment variables unchanged
- Backward compatible with existing submissions

### Monitoring
After deployment, monitor:
1. PDF file sizes (should be similar, maybe slightly larger)
2. Generation time (should be comparable)
3. Email delivery success rates
4. User feedback on document quality

## Follow-up Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Test thoroughly** with real submissions before production deployment
2. **Review sample PDFs** with stakeholders for approval
3. **Monitor first 10-20 submissions** after deployment

### Medium Term
1. Consider adding **custom fonts** for even better typography
2. Add **configurable styling** per project (colors, branding)
3. Implement **template header/footer** with logos

### Long Term
1. Consider **PDF/A compliance** for long-term archival
2. Add **accessibility features** (tagged PDFs)
3. Implement **digital signatures** for submitted documents

## Summary

This fix resolves a **critical formatting bug** that made submissions completely unreadable. The changes ensure submissions are now professional, well-structured, and suitable for formal council submission.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for testing and deployment
**Priority:** üî¥ Critical - Affects all submissions
**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low - No breaking changes, only improvements

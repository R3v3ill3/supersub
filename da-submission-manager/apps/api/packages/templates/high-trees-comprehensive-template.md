## Submission Details
**Position on Development Application:** **OBJECTING**

### Objection to Development Application {{application_number}}

**Subject:** Objection to Development Application {{application_number}}, {{site_address}}

I strongly oppose the proposed development at {{site_address}}. This submission outlines my objections based on the development's non-compliance with the Gold Coast City Plan, the South-East Queensland Regional Plan (SEQRP), and applicable zone codes. I urge Council to refuse this development application due to its significant negative impacts on the community, environmental integrity, and infrastructure.

### Grounds for Objection

{{grounds_content}}

### Planning Framework Non-Compliance

**Gold Coast City Plan Non-Compliance:**
The proposed development directly contradicts the intent of the Gold Coast City Plan. The development encroaches on areas designated for natural landscape protection, violating strategic framework requirements for settlement pattern and undermining efforts to preserve important environmental areas.

The project conflicts with greenspace network requirements, which are critical for maintaining local wildlife habitats and corridors. The intensity, scale, and traffic generation are inconsistent with intended land use, leading to detrimental changes in area character and quality of life.

**South-East Queensland Regional Plan Non-Compliance:**
The site falls within the Regional Landscape and Rural Production Area (RLRPA) under the SEQRP, which aims to protect rural values from urban encroachment. The proposed facility introduces infrastructure incompatible with rural character and represents inappropriate urban development restricted under RLRPA provisions.

**Traffic and Infrastructure Concerns:**
The proposed infrastructure cannot support additional traffic generated by the development. Insufficient sightlines and road width make necessary traffic management unfeasible, creating potential safety hazards. Parking arrangements do not meet required capacity standards. Service and maintenance vehicle requirements have not been adequately assessed for impact on local road network.

**Environmental and Amenity Impact:**
The development impacts areas of significant vegetation and threatens local biodiversity. Removal of established trees compromises ecological integrity. The development increases stormwater runoff risks, potentially harming local water bodies critical for drinking and irrigation. Construction and operational activities will generate noise disrupting rural tranquility. The development's scale and form will cause visual intrusion detracting from natural rural landscape character.

**Community Need Assessment:**
The applicant has not demonstrated legitimate need for this facility in the rural setting. Extended operational hours will result in increased noise and traffic disturbance to the local community. Inadequate lighting and security planning poses concerns for adjacent residents regarding light pollution and safety.

### Conclusion

The proposed development is unsuitable for this rural area. It violates multiple planning frameworks, will severely impact local residents' quality of life, disrupt the rural landscape, and pose significant environmental and infrastructure risks. The non-compliance with both the Gold Coast City Plan and SEQ Regional Plan provides compelling grounds for refusing this development application.

I urge Council to refuse this development application and prioritise preservation of rural character, environmental integrity, and community welfare.

The above grounds focus on planning issues and demonstrate how the proposed development is inconsistent with the Gold Coast City Plan, specifically addressing:

- Compliance with applicable zones and overlays
- Consistency with strategic framework and local government infrastructure plan  
- Assessment against relevant planning scheme codes
- Consideration of State Planning Policy requirements
- Impact on community values and local character as outlined in the City Plan

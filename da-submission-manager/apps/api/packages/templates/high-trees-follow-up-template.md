## Submission Details
**Position on Development Application:** **OBJECTING**

### Follow-Up Objection - Changed Development Application

**Subject:** Further Objection – Changed Development Application {{application_number}}, {{site_address}}

I previously lodged a detailed submission on {{previous_submission_date}} objecting to the proposed development at {{site_address}}. I maintain all of the grounds outlined in that submission, as the revised application fails to address the fundamental conflicts with the Gold Coast City Plan, the South-East Queensland Regional Plan (SEQRP), and applicable zone codes.

This follow-up submission highlights additional concerns arising from the applicant's amended proposal:

### Amended Grounds for Objection

{{grounds_content}}

### Conclusion

The amended proposal fails to resolve the original grounds for objection and instead introduces new and more significant impacts. It remains inconsistent with the intent of the Gold Coast City Plan, the SEQRP, and applicable zone codes, which seek to preserve natural landscape and community values.

I respectfully request that Council refuse the application in its amended form, on the grounds that it represents inappropriate development with unacceptable impacts on traffic, environment, and community amenity.

The above grounds focus on planning issues and demonstrate how the proposed development is inconsistent with the Gold Coast City Plan, specifically addressing:

- Compliance with applicable zones and overlays
- Consistency with strategic framework and local government infrastructure plan  
- Assessment against relevant planning scheme codes
- Consideration of State Planning Policy requirements
- Impact on community values and local character as outlined in the City Plan
